One thing I had trouble with during this project was nested form helpers. For instance, while adding or editing a user, I wanted to be able to edit their roles. This was made difficult as I wanted to see one role form-question per circle, instead of per each role. The latter approach seemed better documented (having the nested form iterate over each :through table, instead of the other side of the many-to-many relationship).
I ended up figuring out a workaround, however in order to do so I had to give each combination of User and Circle its own Role, even if it was just 'none'. This turned out to not be a big issue, at least it isn't for now.
